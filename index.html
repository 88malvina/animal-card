			<p><em>Minions live on the planet for a couple of million years longer than us. They have one obtrusive idea - to serve the most disgusting personality available. Dinosaurs, pharaohs, Dracula, Napoleon - all of them were short-lived. And then the minions jerked into New York. They are waiting for money, power, the fateful super-villain Scarlet Overkill and, of course, the delicious "banana"! In any case, it seems to them.</em></p>
